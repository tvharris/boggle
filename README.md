# Boggle Word Search

## Description

This is an implentation of a word search in the style of the game Boggle. 
The program finds all valid words in a random or user-provided 4x4 (or other size) 
matrix. The words are output to the console and returned as a Set.

Words are validated using the provided word list and the rules of Boggle:
Words are composed of letters connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, 
and they must be at least 3 letters long.

## Usage

To run with the provided files, execute
`node boggle.js twl06.txt matrix.json`

More generally:
`node boggle.js words_file [matrix_file]`

`words_file` is a text file containing a list of words (**Unix newline delimited**).

`matrix_file` (optional) is a **JSON-formatted** matrix of letters (A-Z).
If a filename is not provided for the matrix, a 4x4 matrix of random letters is used.
 
## Source of Word List

`twl06.txt` is the North America Scrabble word list from https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/word-lists/
